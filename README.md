# Utilies usages monitoring system based on IoT (Netduino Hackster.io project 2018).
## Summary
The main idea for this project is, building a dashboard for monitoring the utilities usages such as water, gas, electricity. The system is helpful for prepaid users, since prepaid users need to buy credits before use them. Its really difficult for users to check the usages and tracking the remaining credits regularly. The prepaid utility system automatically cut the line if their the remaining credits
goes zero. This project helps users to prevent cut off situation by monitoring the usages regularly. The system also provides sms based push notification to users if the credits goes low (This part is left for future work). The postpaid users also get benefited from this system. postpaid users able to know the usages amount, which is helpful for excess bills. The utility companies remotely monitor their meters by using this system which is helpful for preparing the postpaid bills. Additional features may be added depending the users/companies needs.
